# MovieRecommendationSystem

This is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Flask that suggests movies based on a user's input. The system leverages cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectorization to find movies with similar characteristics (e.g., genres, cast, keywords, tagline, and director).
